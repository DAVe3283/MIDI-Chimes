Looks like I can run 3 chimes per PIC without issue. The 4th PWM channel
conflicts with I2C and SPI, so I wouldn't be able to talk to the PIC.

Pin		Function
===		========
Pin 1	Vdd (+5V, ICSP)
Pin 2	RA5 (PS_Enable)
Pin 3	AN3
Pin 4	/MCLR (ICSP)
Pin 5	PWM 1 (Transistor 1)
Pin 6	RC4 (Address_Latch)
Pin 7	PWM 2 (Transistor 2)
Pin 8	RC2 (LED)
Pin 9	I2C (SDA)
Pin 10	I2C (SCL)
Pin 11	PWM 3 (Transistor 3)
Pin 12	AN1, ICSPCLK
Pin 13	AN0, ICSPDAT
Pin 14	Vss (Ground, ICSP)

Note: I can swap pins 2, 6, & 8 as needed, since they are just digital I/O.

---==[Analog Pins]==---
Analog pins are used to measure transistor collector voltage (through a 
voltage divider).
This lets me see if they failed in the on state. If I get ambitious, I can also
see if they are turning on correctly. As appropriate, I will force the power
supply off (to prevent burning out a coil and/or a fire), and/or send a fault
message back to the Teensy.

---==[PS_Enable]==---
This pin is tied to the watchdog timer driven by the Teensy. When toggling, the
watchdog turns on the power supply. If there is a fault, the PIC will force this
to ground, in turn forcing the power supply off. The Teensy can detect this, and
will query the I2C bus to find which module faulted. (I might also query fault
status periodically from the Teensy.)

---==[Address_Latch]==---
This pin is used to indicate the I2C address previously broadcast on the bus
should be the new I2C address of this chip. It is used to allow dynamic address
selection of a string of driver boards, enabling easy replacement.
The pin is tied to the LED pin of the previous board (or the master Teensy). If
the chip is in startup mode, it latches the address. Once it has latched an
address, it ignores this input for the duration of operation.

---==[LED]==---
The LED will be illuminated if a fault is detected, allowing the driver board to
easily be identified for replacement. The Teensy will also display which board
failed, but this makes things even more clear.
This pin is also used to latch the address into the next chip during startup.

---==[ICSP]==---
In Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP) require re-use of the AN0-1 pins. Since
they are on a voltage divider, this should still work, even with the power
supply on. If the power supply is off or disconnected, there will be no problem.
