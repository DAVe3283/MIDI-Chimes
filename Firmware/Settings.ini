[Notes]
; This section defines what notes are attached to what chimes.
; They can be either MIDI note numbers (61) or a note name (C#5).
; Note names must be of the format <note><sharp?><octave>, in that order.
; Each slave must have exactly 10 channels. If a slave doesn't have anything
; connected to that channel, use -1 or "NC" (not connected).
Slave0 =  F#5 E5  D5  C5  A#4 C4  D4  E4  F#4 G#4
Slave1 =  A#3 G#3 G3  A3  B3  NC  NC  NC  NC  NC
Slave2 =  C#4 D#4 F4  G4  A4  G5  F5  D#5 C#5 B4

[Calibration]
; These values are used to calibrate the individual chimes by adjusting the
; velocity they are struck with. Values are a percentage, 0.0 - 100.0%
; If no calibration is supplied, it is assumed to be 100% (no adjustment).
; Note: a calibration of 0% won't disable a chime, it just drops it to the
; lowest velocity we can still strike it with.
G3 = 10%
60 = 92.3
C4 = 0.0%
; If a note has multiple calibrations, the first numeric value (60) found takes
; precedence, and if no numeric values are found, the first name (C4) is used.
