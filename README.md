# MIDI-Chimes
Software &amp; notes from retrofitting some old chimes to MIDI control

Eventually, this will contain schematics, PCB layouts, data sheets, and source
code to make everything work. I will add things as I get to them.

## Project Details

TODO: writeup project details

## Firmware

The project uses a Teensy 3.1 and several PIC16F1503 microcontrollers.
The firmware for them are in the appropriate subdirectories.
(Or will be, as they are developed).

## Schematics

TODO

## License

Content in each folder may be licensed differently. Overall, I strive to use the
Unlicense, but some portions may use external libraries preventing that. Those
portions will be license as necessary. Data sheets and the like are provided for
reference only, and are subject to all licenses/copyright specified within.
